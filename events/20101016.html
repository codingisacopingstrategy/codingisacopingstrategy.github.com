You see him from beneath, in profile, starting from the thighs. You can not see his eyes. His right hand holds a remote release firmly. The flash of the camera has overlit his hand and produced a large shadow to his right." />

<p>Philoweb as a conference hopes to play a foundational role in helping to define what a genuine Philosophy of the Web would be. The symposium itself includes presentations by both scholars in philosophy and computer science and engineers. My role was to re-examine the topics from another point of view, that of the artist.</p>

<p>My presentation first went into semantics, as a reaction to the talks on the conference which had to do with codifying semantics for the internet. I talked about what semantics means to an artist, and how categorisation and description are not all that meaning amounts to (and neither are they value free, for that matter).</p>

<p>Then I introduced the pictures by telling a story about a friend who is on a meaning diet.</p>
