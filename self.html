  <p>I made this drawing the 17th of September 2009, while I had a meeting at the Van Abbe museum. In the weeks leading up to this meeting, my sensation that I understood everything rose. I tried to share my understanding at the meeting and used this drawing as an illustration during this attempt.</p>

  <p>This is a model for the mismatch between the words and the things.</p>
  
  <p>There not so many things, there are much more words. And the things are always in a state of flux, thanks to time and causality which keep changing them around.</p>
  
  <p>So while we keep making circles in our minds, revisiting the same words over and over, the same words are never the same because the things they refer to keep changing.</p>
  
  <p>The actual relation between our thoughts and the things is not a circle, it’s a spiral.</p>
  
  <p>Going in circles in mathematical terms would be a parametric plot x: sin(t), y: cos(t) where t is time from 0 to infinity. But this model features a third axis, z, which is equal to t. From a top down perspective it looks just like a circle, but if we shift, we see it is actually a helix, and the points never touch.</p>
  
  <p>You could visualise the point being made as a helix viewed from above: this looks like a circle. Once your viewpoint shifts you see see there is a third axis and the points do not actually touch. The basic parametric formula for such a helix would be: <em>sin(t),cos(t),t</em>.</p>
