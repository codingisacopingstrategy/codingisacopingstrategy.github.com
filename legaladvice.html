The text on the site of the Stimuleringsfonds:

Eric Schrijver (Amsterdam, 1984) obtained an MA in Graphic Design from KASK, Gent in 2013. As a graphic designer, software developer and author, he takes an active role in shaping his tools. Eric develops hybrid publishing workflows, where a project is conceived both for screen and print, often in collaboration with the Brussels based design caravan Open Source Publishing. Eric has taught workshops around the world and is a tutor at the Royal Academy of Art, The Hague, where he teaches coding. He directs a blog called ‘I like tight pants and mathematics’ that aims to motivate designers and artists to get involved in the culture of computer programming.

The Grant Programme for Talent Development enables Eric to create a publication called ‘Legal Advice for Artists’, an irreverent guide to copyright. LAfA provides a map for navigating the paradoxes of intellectual property today. For artists and designers copyright is a double edged sword: while makers can enjoy its protection when exploiting their own works, the creation of these works becomes difficult, as the ability to build upon the work of others has been restraint. LAfA looks at the basic parameters of copyrights: who gets it? for what work? how? and for how long? It investigates the underlying concepts of authorship and original creation. Then: how do the categories of copyright apply to different media, and what happens when a work moves from medium to medium? And how does copyright relate to the web of related legal concepts: moral rights, image rights, trademarks, patents?

LAfA wants to allow artists not just to understand copyright, but also re-claim a role in debate on the legal conditions of their profession. After all, law makers and the media industry invoke the figure of the artist to justify increased copyrights. Even cultural institutions can turn themselves against both artists and the public, by making false copyright claims on the works in their collections. LAfA hopes to be a valuable tool for of artists educating themselves in intellectual property law, who formulate their own responses to the urgent questions copyright creates today. LAfA is a legal experiment in its own right: it is illustrated with images whose right to publish is contested.

The text on the Exhibition:

Eric Schrijver – Legal Advice for Artists (working title)

Legal Advice for Artists is an irreverent guide to copyright – a renowned double-edged sword for artists and designers. On the one hand, makers can benefit from the protection that copyright offers, while on the other, it problematizes the creative process because copyright limits the possibilities for building upon the work of others. 

‘No Known Restrictions: The Public Domain’ is a sample chapter from Schrijver’s upcoming publication, Legal Advice for Artists. This chapter focuses on cultural works whose copyright has expired. While these works are a rich source for continued artistic creation, cultural institutions and the copyright heirs are reluctant to give up their control over this heritage. 

Schrijver created a series of postcards intended to be an educational tool and a legal precedent. With the postcards, he brings attention to how the act of publishing contributes can shape the legal frameworks of copyright. Schrijver, therefore, reveals how the implications of legal rights are up for debate. With this project, he encourages artists to take part in discussions about copyright.

It will explain both the practice of copyright and the underlying philosophies, enabling its readers to apply its knowledge in their own practice and to partake in debates on the future of intellectual property. It combines the practical and critical, the how and why, in a compact, contemporary, readable volume packed with strong examples, in an attractive design. <a href="assets/legal_advice_for_artists_sample_chapter_public_domain_29_october_version_0.2.pdf">Download the sample chapter ‘No Known Restrictions: the Public Domain’</a>.</p>

<p>For the Dutch Design Week, 4 postcards were published that offer a taste of the project, you can download them below. These postcards, presented as part of an installation, chart the limits of copyright in different ways. If you are interestested in collaborating on the final publication don’t hesitate to get in touch!</p>
<!---Copyright can both empower creatives and limit them. 
<p>LAfA is an Irreverent Guide to Copyright, written for makers. It combines the practical and critical, the how and why, in a compact, contemporary, readable volume packed with strong examples, in an attractive design.</p>
<p>LAfA recognises the paradox intellectual property poses to artists and designers. On the one hand, makers can benefit from the protection that copyright offers, while on the other, it problematises the creative process because copyright limits the possibilities for building upon the work of others.</p>
<p>LAfA looks at the basic parameters of copyrights: who gets it? for what work? how? and for how long? Then: how do the categories of copyright apply to different media, and what happens when a work moves from medium to medium? And how does copyright relate to the web of related legal concepts: moral rights, image rights, trademarks, patents?</p>
<p>LAfA is going to be a practical guide yet for all the real-world examples it will discuss how they relate to the concepts of authorship and original creation that underly our legal system. Beyond providing them with the tools to navigate the paradox of copyright in their own practice, it will equip readers with the conceptual keys to participate in the debate on copyright today.</p>
