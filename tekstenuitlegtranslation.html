<h2>translation</h2>

	<h3>0:02&mdash;Rokus:</h3>
		<p>I have some sort of professional ethics in which I should at least sustain the sentence until, well, until the next full stop. I really feel like, it&rsquo;s the specific role, it&rsquo;s the task I set myself of doing, that has an appeal for me, to make a sentence that lands on its feet, to make a sentence which, which has the right amount of suspense, which has the right rhythm, it is&mdash;that is a, a sentence that, that, that lands on its feet so beautifully, with those alliterations and that internal rhyme: it lands beautifully on its feet, it really has that, that, that&hellip; when I'm tinkering with my sentences, plodding away to get those sentences&mdash;yes&mdash;tinkering with sentences that is my&mdash;with, with written sentences, that in fact is my, my craft, and this, this wrenching with such a sentence is what constitutes my, my&hellip; yeah, my real job and it&rsquo;s also the thing in which, in which I can get lost completely, but that&mdash;yes that&mdash;you can hear from my hesitations that the words don&rsquo;, don&rsquo;t bubble up spontaneously, but&mdash;and yes there are people who think I tend to express myself in a mannered fashion every now and again&mdash;and I sometimes find it hard to just prattle, I am, I can be be searching for words and I am, can be pretty jealous of people who just, you know, shoot the bull, and uhm, furthermore uhm&hellip; well actually I've gone too far now: 'all's well that ends well', that's where i should have stopped.</p>
	
	<h3>2:41&mdash;Oscar:</h3>
<p>That is interesting, that is the only thing which I find interesting, everything else I don&rsquo;t find interesting, not interesting at all&mdash;I find it be so very uninteresting, I uhm&hellip; I am not interested in that. But, I don&rsquo;t know if this answers your question.  This too doesn't feel like an answer to your question. Uhm, why I write and what it is I want to tell and what language is and uhm what cooperation is, what friendship is, what it uhm means to be on the world together; the searching the wanting and the desire to understand and the desire to transcend your loneliness in not understanding the world; why I am here and what the world means and how you can reach another person and how you transcend your own loneliness and how you want to embrace the other by making him understand; how you see the world, how you are brought into this world alone, how you shape a world view during the course of your life; how I once got born and learned language and how I used the language to find a sense of security and to make myself clear and how I subsequently tried to get away from that because I didn't believe in it&mdash;what translation is, and how that affects a story and how that affects something inside of you. Yes. And&hellip; yes. Yes! No.</p>

	<h3>5:16&mdash;Arie:</h3>
<p>There are chairs in this room. Will you come along or will you not come along, will you stay here or not, I want you to accept something from me, it&rsquo;s plenty comfortable here, don&rsquo;t go away, well we still have something, we can still enjoy something, we have, you don&rsquo;t have to be immediately replenished we also don&rsquo;t have to immediately leave, all these kinds of things, imagine in case you are in one of these uhm outdoor caf&eacute;s. I guess it&rsquo;s pleasant here, the chances of it being pleasant here are greater than the chances of it not being pleasant&mdash;that is my point, that there, there is always something which you want to do together with someone else or what you want to get done from someone else even if it&rsquo;s rather insignificant, but you want to get something done, and how you put the words into action, for the rhetoric side, the persuasive side, when you know that, this is my proposition, then&mdash;and only then&mdash;then you know the meaning.</p>

	<p>Uhm&hellip; but we do play this game, uhm intrinsically we could have done it different, differently, but we play this game here because that's just the way we do things. The game of driving on the right side, the game of driving on the left side, the game in which you, in order to distinguish spatial relations, make use of north and south, the game of left and right&mdash;the analytical game: the insight that also science is a conventional game, led by conventions&hellip; that in itself doesn't make for a moral imperative: if you want to take the advice of an old and wise man&mdash;ridiculous that I should say so, but that makes for a, I find that to be a remainder of absolutism.</p>

<p><i>Oscar:</i> Yes, yes, that's how it is. Yes, that's how it is. I can't formulate it more fitting than this. <i>Rokus:</i> &lsquo;Hey it&rsquo;s correct&rsquo;, yes. <i>Arie:</i> Yes, that's what I think, yes, yes, exactly, yes&mdash;yes that's the story of the mother tongue, yes, exactly, yes, yes, yes&hellip;</p>
